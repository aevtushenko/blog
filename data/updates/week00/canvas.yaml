     The primary customer of this app is the group of Yale college students that 
     is looking for a late-night snack in their buttery (or another buttery on 
     campus).

      *There is no centralized location of menus, times, or locations for the 
      campus butteries. 
      *Students have to go to the buttery to place their order, where things 
      are either out of stock/there is a long wait for food.

      A web application that lists the butteries, their hours, locations and 
      menus would resolve the first problem, as there would be a central website 
      that students could go to to obtain information on the butteries. The web 
      application would allow students to place orders to the buttery, displaying 
      the orders to the workers downstairs and an approximate pickup time, and 
      would allow each buttery manager to edit the menu as they see fit (or run 
      out of a product). Think about it as a Yale Dining App for butteries, with 
      additional features (ordering, music requests, etc.)


  - title: How we know this is a problem

    description: |
      Nick is a buttery manager, and has noticed that fewer students are coming
      to his own buttery (and others through talking to the managers) because 
      they are too busy to be distracted by buttery culture. In addition, many 
      people do not know when their own butteries (or others, for that matter) 
      are open, and are usually pleasantly surprised when they find out that 
      Davenport’s buttery is open on weekends.


  - title: Acquiring customers
    invalidated: false # whether this has been invalidated. Used to show change
    confidence: 5
    description: |
      To reach these customers, each individual buttery manager can advertise 
      the website through their college’s panlist server (which sends to all 
      residents of that particular college). Most butteries send out an email 
      every week or so to the entire college, and can include the link in these 
      emails. It could also come through each college’s council, which sends 
      out college-wide updates to all students. Social media posts would also 
      advertise to each student’s personal connections, and would hopefully 
      broaden the market of users.


  - title: Profitability
    invalidated: false # whether this has been invalidated. Used to show change
    confidence: 5
    description: |
      The app itself would be non-profit (meaning, the information and service 
      would be provided to butteries and students at no cost). However, we hope
      that the web application will increase the profits of the butteries around 
      campus.



  - title: Risks
    invalidated: false # whether this has been invalidated. Used to show change
    confidence: 5
    description: |
      *Other buttery managers do not buy into the service 
      *Students do not use the web application for information or ordering
      *The online ordering system destroys the culture of hanging out with 
      friends in the buttery
      *The web application is not actually useful for ordering and is 
      glitchy/difficult to use by buttery teams across campus
      *The buttery managers fail to update information and the web application 
      falls out of use due to old, static information

      By piloting the project in Davenport’s buttery first, we can easily work 
      out glitches for other butteries, and can get user feedback from the 
      customers there. This gives us an opportunity to talk with users, and ask 
      them what they would like to see as part of the web application. By 
      making the app as great as it can be in a few weeks, we can pitch the 
      best product possible to other butteries, and will hopefully get buy-in 
      from them to use the app. At the very least, whether or not each buttery 
      decides to use the built-in ordering system, we will have an application 
      that will give the student body information as to what’s going on in the 
      butteries, working hours and location in the least.

      Since our website will connect students to their butteries, we plan to 
      develop relationships with all 12 buttery managers so they can connect 
      with their prospective customers through each 400-person residential 
      college. To develop value, we need to build a buttery menu and time of 
      operations, an out of stock list, an order queue, possibly a song request 
      platform, a food item request platform and, if we have the time, a payment 
      method potentially through Square.
        
      As a user, I can in log in with my netID credentials and choose a 
      residential college buttery. There, I can see operating hours, a list of 
      menu items and if the item is out of stock, there will be a stick-through 
      on the item name. That will be the main page of the website. On the top, 
      there will be other tabs like My Orders (where you can see previous orders 
      and send an order to a buttery), Request a Song (where you can queue up a 
      song on Spotify), Request Food (where you can send suggestions to buttery 
      managers on what to carry), and a Feedback/Contact Us for internal 
      development.

    *The data for this application follows a more or less static structure. The 
    only properties that differ between butteries are menu items which just 
    involves adding more rows. The properties (name, price, availability) pretty
    much cover all the features of this app and, since there’s no plans to expand 
    beyond the 12 butteries a traditional relational database seems like the 
    best course of action.
    *From a technical perspective this application is not that complicated. 
    The app will merely need to pull hours / food availability / price from the 
    database and then draw it on the app. Since butteries obviously won’t deliver 
    there’s no need to do in-app payment since they can just pay at the buttery 
    (potentially with square as previously mentioned) which removes any need for 
    encrypted credit cards numbers or any other security vulnerabilities. It is, 
    at its core, a simple application that follows MVC.
    *Users are divided into vendors and customers, and orders from the customers 
    show up in the vendors’ dashboards
    *Users are named based on their netIDs to prevent fake accounts from placing 
    fake orders
    *Placing orders is handled with a simple form that users submit in a similar 
    manner to the social to-do app, 
    *As previously mentioned, this code will be deployed via collaboration with 
    the buttery managers. It will be developed as a web application and pushed 
    to mobile via something like Mozilla Prism.
